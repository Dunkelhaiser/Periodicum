Fluorine has a number of important industrial applications, including its use in the production of uranium, aluminum, and other metals. It is also used in the production of a variety of chemicals, including refrigerants, solvents, and polymers. Fluorine is widely used in toothpaste and water fluoridation as it is effective in preventing tooth decay. Fluorine is also used in the nuclear industry as a key component of uranium enrichment processes. Fluorine gas is extremely toxic and can cause severe burns if it comes into contact with skin, so it is handled with great care in industry and research."

Chlorine is used extensively in industry, as a disinfectant, and in the production of a wide variety of chemicals, including solvents, plastics, and insecticides. It is also used to purify water supplies and swimming pools. Chlorine has important biological functions, and is an essential nutrient for many organisms, including humans. It is used by the body to produce hydrochloric acid in the stomach, which helps to digest food. However, exposure to high levels of chlorine gas can be harmful and can cause severe respiratory problems, and chlorine-containing chemicals can be toxic if ingested or absorbed through the skin. Chlorine is also a major contributor to ozone depletion, and its emissions are tightly regulated in many countries."

Argon has many important industrial applications, such as its use in welding and metal fabrication, as a protective atmosphere for the production of electronic components, and in the production of light bulbs. It is also used in scientific research, particularly in studies of the behavior of atoms and molecules. While argon is generally considered non-toxic, it can displace oxygen in poorly ventilated areas, leading to asphyxiation, and should be handled with care."

However, arsenic is highly toxic and exposure to high levels can cause various health issues, including skin lesions, respiratory problems, and an increased risk of cancer. Arsenic contamination of groundwater is a serious global problem, particularly in developing countries, and can lead to significant health problems for those who consume it."

Its isotopes have a half-life ranging from a few days to thousands of years, and the decay products can release dangerous alpha, beta, and gamma radiation. Radium has been used in various applications, including as a cancer treatment and in luminous paints, but due to its highly toxic nature, its use is now heavily restricted."

Uranium-235 is the most important isotope for nuclear power and weapons, as it is fissile, meaning it can be split by neutrons and release energy."
